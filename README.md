## About

Fluid Earth Viewer (FEVer) is an interactive web application that allows you to
visualize current and past conditions of Earthâ€™s atmosphere and oceans. FEVer is
developed and maintained by The Ohio State University's Byrd Polar and Climate
Research Center.

You can use FEVer to learn about the atmosphere and oceans by exploring the
daily conditions in places where you live, work, and play or examining whole
regions of the planet over years. In particular, FEVer provides hands-on
visualizations of conditions in polar regions, changes they are undergoing, and
connections between polar regions and the rest of the planet. Built on an
open-source application, FEVer is a vehicle for modern Earth science
communication, making information used by the scientific community accessible
and engaging to everyone. FEVer is explorable 24 hours a day, 7 days a week
using your computer, tablet, and smartphone.

You can see the current FEVer in action [here](https://fever.byrd.osu.edu).

If you are interested in using FEVer for educational purposes or collaborating
with us to develop FEVer for a specific application, please email
